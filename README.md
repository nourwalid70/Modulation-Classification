# Modulation-Classification
A modulation-classification model that is trained and tested on DeepSig Dataset: RadioML 2016.04C: A synthetic dataset, generated with GNU Radio, consisting of 11 modulations. This is a variable-SNR dataset with moderate LO drift, light fading, and numerous different labeled SNR increments for use in measuring performance across different signal and noise power scenarios.
